      <p>A brief introduction to the 3-2 program and my experience as a student at Columbia University.</p>
<p>As a beneficiary of 3-2 program, or &quot;Combiend plan&quot;,
I am now a student at Columbia University. I will share my experience and thoughts about the program.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-3-2-program%3F" tabindex="-1">What is 3-2 program?</h2>
<p>The <strong>3-2 program</strong> (also known as a Dual Degree Program) allows students to complete three years of study at a liberal arts college and then transfer to an affiliated engineering school for an additional two years. After completing the five-year program, students typically receive two degrees: a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) from the liberal arts college and a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in engineering from the engineering school.</p>
<p>This program is designed for students who want a strong liberal arts education combined with an engineering focus. Grinnell College, where you studied, offers a 3-2 program in partnership with various engineering schools, including Columbia University.</p>
<h2 id="why-did-i-choose-the-3-2-program%3F" tabindex="-1">Why did I choose the 3-2 program?</h2>
<p>I chose the 3-2 program because I wanted to combine my interests in the humanities and engineering. I enjoyed studying at Grinnell College and appreciated the small class sizes and close relationships with professors. However, I also wanted to pursue a career in engineering and felt that the 3-2 program would provide me with the technical skills and knowledge I needed to succeed in the field.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-prepare-to-the-3-2-program-application%3F" tabindex="-1">How to prepare to the 3-2 program application?</h2>
<p>In fact, you will need to plan ahead and take specific courses to prepare for the 3-2 program application. For example, you will need to complete the necessary prerequisites for the engineering school you plan to attend. In other words, you will need to plan your coursework carefully to ensure that you meet the requirements for the 3-2 program starting in your first year at liberal arts college.</p>
<p>Depending on the engineering school you plan to attend, you may need to take courses in calculus, physics, chemistry, and computer science. You may also need to complete a certain number of credits in the humanities and social sciences to fulfill.</p>
<h2 id="how-competitive-is-the-3-2-program%3F" tabindex="-1">How competitive is the 3-2 program?</h2>
<p>The competitiveness of the 3-2 program varies depending on the engineering school you plan to attend. Some engineering schools have more stringent requirements than others.</p>
<p>As a Grinnell College student, Washington University in St. Louis will admit you to the 3-2 program if you meet the minimum requirements, including a minimum GPA and completion of the necessary prerequisites. A good new is that if you contact WUSTL, even if you did not meet the minimum requirements, you can still be admitted to the program if you demonstrate a strong interest in engineering and a commitment to the program.</p>
<p>For Columbia University, the 3-2 program is competitive, and only about half of students are admitted each year. To be admitted to the program, you will need to have a strong academic record, including a high GPA and completion of all necessary prerequisites.</p>
<p>If Caltech is your dream school, you will need to have a very strong academic record and demonstrate a strong research background to be admitted to the 3-2 program. Caltech is one of the most competitive engineering schools in 3/2 program list. In past years, only a one or two students from Grinnell College were admitted to the program.</p>
