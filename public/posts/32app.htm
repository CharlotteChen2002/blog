<p>This is a collorbative blog post about the 3-2 program from some students at Columbia University.</p>
<p>As beneficiaries of 3-2 program, or &quot;Combiend plan&quot;, We are now students at Columbia University. We will share my experience and thoughts about the program. In this post, we will share our experience and thoughts about the 3-2 program. We will discuss what the 3-2 program is, why we chose it, how to prepare for the application, and how competitive it is. We hope that this post will help you decide if the 3-2 program is right for you.</p>
<h2 id="what-is-3-2-program%3F" tabindex="-1">What is 3-2 program?</h2>
<p>The <strong>3-2 program</strong> (also known as a Dual Degree Program) allows students to complete three years of study at a liberal arts college and then transfer to an affiliated engineering school for an additional two years. After completing the five-year program, students typically receive two degrees: a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) from the liberal arts college and a Bachelor of Science (B.S.) in engineering from the engineering school.</p>
<p>This program is designed for students who want a strong liberal arts education combined with an engineering focus. It allows students to explore a wide range of subjects in the humanities, social sciences, and natural sciences before specializing in engineering. The 3-2 program is a great option for students who are interested in both the humanities and engineering and want to combine their interests in a unique way.</p>
<p>Different LACs have different engineering schools that they are affiliated with. Some of the most popular engineering schools for 3-2 programs include:</p>

<h2 id="why-did-i-choose-the-3-2-program%3F" tabindex="-1">Why did I choose the 3-2 program?</h2>
<p><em>I chose the 3-2 program because I wanted to combine my interests in the humanities and engineering. I enjoyed studying at Grinnell College and appreciated the small class sizes and close relationships with professors. However, I also wanted to pursue a career in engineering and felt that the 3-2 program would provide me with the technical skills and knowledge I needed to succeed in the field.</em></p>

<h2 id="how-to-prepare-to-the-3-2-program-application%3F" tabindex="-1">How to prepare to the 3-2 program application?</h2>
<p>In fact, you will need to plan ahead and take specific courses to prepare for the 3-2 program application. For example, you will need to complete the necessary prerequisites for the engineering school you plan to attend. In other words, you will need to plan your coursework carefully to ensure that you meet the requirements for the 3-2 program starting in your first year at liberal arts college.</p>
<p>Depending on the engineering school you plan to attend, you may need to take courses in calculus, physics, chemistry, and computer science. You may also need to complete a certain number of credits in the humanities and social sciences to fulfill.</p>
<h2 id="how-competitive-is-the-3-2-program%3F" tabindex="-1">How competitive is the 3-2 program?</h2>
<p>The competitiveness of the 3-2 program varies depending on the engineering school you plan to attend. Some engineering schools have more stringent requirements than others.</p>
<h3 id="grinnell-college" tabindex="-1">Grinnell College</h3>
<p>As a Grinnell College student, Washington University in St. Louis will admit you to the 3-2 program if you meet the minimum requirements, including a minimum GPA and completion of the necessary prerequisites. A good new is that if you contact WUSTL, even if you did not meet the minimum requirements, you can still be admitted to the program if you demonstrate a strong interest in engineering and a commitment to the program.</p>
<p>For Columbia University, the 3-2 program is competitive, and only about half of students are admitted each year. To be admitted to the program, you will need to have a strong academic record, including a high GPA and completion of all necessary prerequisites.</p>
<p>If Caltech is your dream school, you will need to have a very strong academic record and demonstrate a strong research background to be admitted to the 3-2 program. Caltech is one of the most competitive engineering schools in 3/2 program list. In past years, only a one or two students from Grinnell College were admitted to the program.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-apply-to-the-3-2-program%3F" tabindex="-1">How to apply to the 3-2 program?</h2>
<p>To apply to the 3-2 program, you will need to follow the application process for the engineering school you plan to attend. In most cases, you will need to submit an application to the engineering school during your junior year at LAC. Be sure to consult with engineering coordinator at your LAC to ensure that you meet all the requirements for the 3-2 program.</p>
<p>In addition to the application to the engineering school, you will need to ask for recommendation letters from your professors and submit your transcripts. You may also need to write a personal statement explaining why you want to pursue engineering and how the 3-2 program will help you achieve your goals depending on the school.</p>
<p>Some engineering schools have a separate application for school-specific scholarships. However, your scharship from LAC will be not transferable to the engineering school and application for scholarships may impact your admission decision if you are an international student.</p>
